## Voicing contrasts

- **P_VOICE**: Is there a voicing distinction?
- **P_VOICED_PLOSIVES**: Is there a voicing distinction in the plosives?
- **P_VOICED_FRICATIVES**: Is there a voicing distinction in the fricatives?

Note that this does not just mean "Are there phonetically voiced consonants at all?"; most languages, after all , have voiced nasals at least.

## Glottalized consonants

- **P_EJECTIVES**: Are there ejective consonants?
- **P_IMPLOSIVES**: Are there implosive consonants?
- **P_GLOTTALIZED_RESONANTS**: Are there glottalized resonants?

Note that none of these categories contains the glottal stop or breathy consonants.

The sounds captured in a 1.0 valuation of these features might or might not be contrastive.

## Uvular consonants

- **P_UVULARS**: Does the language have any uvular consonants?
- **P_UVULAR_STOPS**: Does the language have uvular stops?
- **P_UVULAR_CONTINUANTS**: Does the language have uvular continuants?


## Lateral consonants

- **P_LATERALS**: Does the language have lateral consonants?
- **P_LATERAL_L**: Does the language have a typical lateral consonant like /l/?
- **P_LATERAL_OBSTRUENTS**: Does the language have lateral obstruents?

Neither of these categories include lateral clicks in WALS.

## Velar nasals

- **P_VELAR_NASAL**: Does the language have a velar nasal?
- **P_VELAR_NASAL_INITIAL**: Does the language have a velar nasal syllable-initially?


## Nasal vowels

- **P_NASAL_VOWELS**: Are nasal vowels contrastive in the language?


## Rounded front vowels

- **P_FRONT_ROUND_VOWELS**: Are there front rounded vowels in the language?


## Common consonant classes sometimes missing

- **P_BILABIALS**: Does the language have bilabial consonants?
- **P_FRICATIVES**: Does the language have fricatives?
- **P_NASALS**: Does the language have nasal consonants?


## Uncommon consonants

- **P_LABIAL_VELARS**: Are there labial-velars (e.g. , "kp" , "gb") in the language?
- **P_CLICKS**: Are there clicks in the language?
- **P_TH**: Are there interdental , dental , or alveolar non-sibilant fricatives (e.g. , "th") in the language?
- **P_PHARYNGEALS**: Are there pharyngeal sounds in the language?


## Syllable structure

- **P_COMPLEX_ONSETS**: Are sequences of consonants permitted in syllable onsets?
- **P_CODAS**: Are codas permitted?
- **P_COMPLEX_CODAS**: Is more than one consonant allowed in a syllable coda?
- **P_LONG_VOWELS**: Are there distinctive long vowels in the language?

Note that these features are meant to describe the syllable structure of native vocabulary; loan words (e.g. , "sport" , "golf") may or may not obey these constraints.

## Tones

- **P_TONE**: Are there contrastive tones in the language?

In WALS , this feature counts languages with somewhat marginal and stress-like tone systems like Norwegian and Japanese as well.
